# 🌌 Pulsar Map Tree

This repository presents a **pulsar-based radial visualization** inspired by astrophysical pulsar maps used to encode the position of the Solar System in space. The project translates this scientific concept into a structured **tree-like representation**, rendered using standard web technologies.

The visualization is designed as an educational and conceptual tool, combining **astronomical geometry**, **polar coordinates**, and **computational visualization**.

## 📖 Scientific Background

Pulsar maps have historically been used to describe the position of the Sun relative to a set of known pulsars, most famously on the **Pioneer plaques**. Each pulsar is represented by a radial line, where the direction encodes angular position and the length represents relative distance or timing information.

This project adopts the same geometric philosophy and reinterprets it as a “tree” structure, where:

- The **Sun** is placed at the center.
- **Pulsar directions** radiate outward in polar coordinates.
- Radial markers visually encode structured information along each pulsar line.
